# Python I3 Bar

Early prototype / probing project for an opinionated i3 window manager bar dedicated for small laptops.

Currently displays workspaces, highlights active workspace, allows switching between them and can be moved around while holding right mouse button. It also stays on top and independent of workspaces on its own, without the need of any changes in the i3 config file.

Currently it uses i3ipc and tkinter, but tkinter will probably be replaced by Gtk.
