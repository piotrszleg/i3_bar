# Python I3 Bar

Early prototype / probing project for an opinionated i3 window manager bar dedicated for small laptops.

Currently displays workspaces, highlights active workspace, shows workspace windows in its tooltip and shows time. When time label is clicked it switches to date. It also stays on top and independent of workspaces on its own, without the need of any changes in the i3 config file.

Written using i3ipc and gtk, should be compatible with swaywm.
